Scrappyr Frontend
=================

This is the frontend code for the Scrappyr app.
See the [README](../../README.md) in the main repo for more details.

This frontend is built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). The choice of
frameworks is a contentious one, but my choice was easy: The goal of this
project was to get better at my day job, and my current project uses AngularJS
quite heavily.
